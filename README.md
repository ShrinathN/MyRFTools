# MyRFTools
A repository so that I never have to lose and re-create my handy tools.

## rx_test
Simple STM32F103C8T6 (blue pill) program to sample PA0 at 100KHz and dump data over UART at 2000000 BAUD.
The sample rate can be increased to 166KHz
I guess this is my poor man's logic analyzer

## grapher.py
Super simple script to record stuff from the UART, and graph it.

## low_pass_filter.py
Contains useful functions and shit. Includes but not limited to a low pass filter
